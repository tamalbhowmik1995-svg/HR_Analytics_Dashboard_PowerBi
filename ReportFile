Key Components of an Attrition Report in Power BI
A comprehensive attrition report typically focuses on several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualizations to understand why employees are leaving.
1. Key Metrics (KPI Cards)
These cards provide a high-level overview of critical numbers:
Total Employees: Current active headcount.
Attrition Count: Total number of employees who left during a specific period.
Attrition Rate: The percentage of employees who left relative to the average number of employees over a set period. Formula: (Number of Separations / Average Number of Employees) * 100.
Average Tenure: The average length of time employees stay with the company.
Average Age: The average age of the workforce or departing employees.
2. Essential Visualizations and Insights
These charts help break down the attrition data by various dimensions to identify trends and underlying causes:
Attrition by Department/Job Role: Identifies which departments (e.g., Sales, R&D) or roles (e.g., Laboratory Technicians) have the highest turnover.
Attrition by Age Group: Highlights age demographics with high attrition (e.g., employees aged 26-35 years).
Attrition by Tenure/Years at Company: Shows if employees are leaving early in their tenure (e.g., within the first 1-5 years) or after significant milestones.
Attrition by Salary Bracket: Compares attrition rates with salary levels to understand if compensation is a factor.
Attrition by Marital Status/Gender: Provides demographic insights into turnover patterns.
Reasons for Attrition: A breakdown of voluntary versus involuntary attrition and specific reasons for leaving (e.g., job dissatisfaction, better career opportunities).
3. Interactivity
The report should include slicers for filtering data by date range, department, location, or manager, allowing HR professionals to drill down into specific areas of concern.
